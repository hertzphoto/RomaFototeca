Data and documentation from the Photographic Collection of the Bibliotheca Hertziana, Max Planck Institute for Art History, Rome, Italy http://www.biblhertz.it/en/photographic-collection/catalogue/.

This repository contains data examples for the PHAROS consortium and associated institutes for photographic resources with objects on fine arts and architecture. The exports are from a local image database, initially edited with HIDA software and transferred to XML in eXist-db. Data structure and contents follow the MIDAS handbook (Bove/Heusinger/Kailus) http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/3770/ in german language.

The updated XML data is provided within the online catalogue of the photographic collection: http://foto.biblhertz.it hosted by the Bibliotheca Hertziana. Data copies are transferred each year to the general database and DISKUS union catalog http://www.bildindex.de, hosted by Foto Marburg, together with the photo data from the Kunsthistorisches Institut at Florence (Max Planck Institute). Some of the object data with original Hertziana photographs are available at the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/?lang=en, where the data https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/searchresults?query=provider%3A%28hertziana%29&offset=0&rows=20 was mapped to LIDO and could also be prepared for Europeana purposes http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en. 

The PHAROS.JSON examples are used for http://images.pharosartresearch.org/source/biblhertz.
